                        Music 21           
                     Rich Metadata  
===========================================================

Music21 provides the following metadata
    [('ambitus', "AmbitusShort(semitones=4, diatonic='M3', pitchLowest='A4', "pitchHighest='C#5')"),
     ('composer', 'Japanese'),
     ('keySignatureFirst', '3'),
     ('keySignatures', '[3]'),
     ('movementName', 'A Cup of Tea'),
     ('noteCount', '37'),
     ('numberOfParts', '1'),
     ('pitchHighest', 'C#5'),
     ('pitchLowest', 'A4'),
     ('quarterLength', '24.0'),
     ('sourcePath', '/Users/admin/Dropbox (Personal)/Score Library/xml/a cup of tea.musicxml'),
     ('tempoFirst', '<music21.tempo.MetronomeMark Quarter=100.0>'),
     ('tempos', "['<music21.tempo.MetronomeMark Quarter=100.0>']"),
     ('timeSignatureFirst', '2/4'),
     ('timeSignatures', "['2/4']")]

Elements we plan to extract:
    ambitus - AmbitusShort - semitones
    ambitus - AmbitusShort - diatonic
    composer
    keySignatures
    movementName
    noteCount
    numberOfParts
    pitchHighest
    pitchLowest
    quarterLength
    timeSignatures

Some of these elements will be processed into a more usable form.
